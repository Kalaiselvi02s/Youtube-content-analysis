# Youtube-content-analysis

Overview:
This project aims to analyze YouTube content data to provide insights for content creators, specifically focusing on the decision-making process between uploading mathematics or physics-related videos.

Technology Used:
Language: R
Libraries: apiclient, unidecode, csv
Analysis Techniques: Time series analysis, correlation analysis, data visualization
Scope:
The project involves collecting data from YouTube using the YouTube Data API, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), performing engagement analysis, time series analysis, and comparing the performance of mathematics and physics-related videos.

Key Steps:
Data Collection: Extract data from YouTube using the YouTube Data API, including metrics like view count, like count, dislike count, comment count, and favorite count.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Explore and visualize the distribution of metrics, such as view counts and engagement metrics, to gain initial insights into the data.
Engagement Analysis: Analyze the relationship between view counts and engagement metrics to understand viewer interactions with the content.
Time Series Analysis: Analyze trends in view counts and engagement metrics over time to identify patterns or seasonality.
Comparison between Topics: Compare the performance of mathematics and physics-related videos based on various metrics to guide content strategy decisions.
